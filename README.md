_observation_ Images rendered with deeper trace level appear darker, which is due to the calculation of ray color. The resulted color is calculated by multiplying the material color of all intersections along the path.

* Refraction

Refraction 1, SPP 1000 | Refraction 2, SPP 5000

_observation_ Since large amount of paths are traced, caustics produced by refraction are free.

* Specular Reflection

Trace Depth 2, SPP 1000 | Trace Depth 8, SPP 1000
