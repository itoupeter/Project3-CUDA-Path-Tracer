### Ray Scattering
* Lambert Diffuse

Trace Depth 2, SPP 1000 | Trace Depth 8, SPP 1000

_observation_ Images rendered with deeper trace level appear darker, which is due to the calculation of ray color. The resulted color is calculated by multiplying the material color of all intersections along the path.

* Refraction

Refraction 1, SPP 1000 | Refraction 2, SPP 5000

_observation_ Since large amount of paths are traced, caustics produced by refraction are free.

* Specular Reflection

Trace Depth 2, SPP 1000 | Trace Depth 8, SPP 1000

* Glossy Reflection

Less Glossy Floor, SPP 3000 | Glossier Floor, SPP 3000

_obervation_ For different types of material, glossiness can be adjusted by tuning the specular exponent. Larger exponent produces reflection closer to mirror.

### Depth of Field

Depth of Field, Far Focal | Depth of Field, Near Focal

_obervation_ There are 2 parameters we can play around with in terms of depth of field, lens radius and focal distance. Larger lens radius produces stronger DoF effect. Focal distance affects the distance the virtual camera is focusing on.

### Antialiasing
